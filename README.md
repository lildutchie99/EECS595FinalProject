EECS595FinalProject

To reproduce, simply run all notebook cells in the same directory as trip_parses.json. Notebook handles installation of all dependencies (spacy 2.1.0, neuralcoref, and numpy). By changing USE_GROUND_TRUTH_STATE_CHANGES and USE_REFINED_TEST_SET in the final cell (and rerunning it), the evaluation configuration for the end tasks can be changed as detailed in the report.
